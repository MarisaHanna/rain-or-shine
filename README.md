#   Five Day Weather Forecast


#   Description

This is my sixth homework project. The task was to create a weather application that gave the user the current tempurature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, and five day forecast from any city around the world that the user searched for. Each day also has an icon image that represents the current and projected weather conditions.
